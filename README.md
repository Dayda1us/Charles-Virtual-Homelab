# Charles' Virtual Homelab Scripting Repository
This GitHub repository is dedicated to storing scripts that serve dual purposes: 
* Managing my virtual homelab environment.
* To keep track of my learning journey across various scripting languages.

## Overview
This repository acts as both a practical toolkit for automating tasks within my personal virtual homelab and a logbook documenting the evolution of my skills in different programming languages. 
It contains scripts primarily written in languages such as Python, Bash, PowerShell, and others. These scripts are designed to automate various functions like server setup, configuration management, network configurations, and more.

## Key Features
* **Learning Log**: Each script is accompanied by notes or comments that reflect the learning progress associated with its development.
* **Automation Utility**: The repository provides practical tools for automating repetitive tasks within a virtual homelab environment, improving efficiency and consistency.
* **Language Diversity**: Scripts span multiple programming languages, offering insights into different scripting paradigms and techniques.

## ⚠️ Considerations
* **Unfinished/Buggy Code**: Be aware that the repository may contain scripts that are not fully completed or have known issues. Users should review and test each script in a safe environment before applying them to their own systems.
* **Personal Evolution**: The code reflects a personal learning journey, which means some scripts might be experimental or exploratory in nature.
